        <h2>1. Introduction to the Destination</h2>
        <p>I traveled to <strong>Montevideo</strong>, the capital of <strong>Uruguay</strong>. It is located by the <em>Río de la Plata</em>, which looks almost like an ocean. The city has a mix of old and modern buildings and is famous for its beaches, friendly people, and love for soccer.</p>
        <p>The weather is mild most of the year. Montevideo has a lot of history from the colonial period and is known for its traditional music called <em>candombe</em>.</p>

        <h2>2. Purpose of the Trip</h2>
        <p>I chose Montevideo because I wanted to visit another South American country and learn more about Uruguayan culture. I also wanted to try local food, see the beaches, and explore the old part of the city.</p>

        <h2>4. Activities and Experiences</h2>
        <p>I watched a <em>candombe</em> performance in the streets. People were very friendly, and some even spoke Portuguese with me.</p>
        <p>I really liked the peaceful atmosphere of the city. Drinking <em>mate</em> by the water was one of the best moments of the trip.</p>
